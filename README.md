Implementation: The webpage you create should closely match the design in Figma to the best of your ability.
HTML: Use basic HTML tags. We're interested in seeing how you structure your HTML and whether you follow basic best practices.
CSS: Do not use any CSS frameworks or libraries. Write your own CSS code to style the webpage. Your ability to create responsive designs and use efficient and clean CSS will be under consideration.
JavaScript: Use vanilla JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks) to implement the interactive elements.
